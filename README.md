# popup-js
Free to use, open source jQuery plugin which provides a customizable Pop-up/Dialog component. Has a stylesheet for the component, but custom styling is also possible.

## Getting Started
The following intructions will provided the knowledge needed to import and implement <span style="font-variant: italic; font-weight: bold;">popup-js</span> into your project. They will only cover basic topics, for users who want to get the plugin up and working as quickly as possible. 

### Prerequisites
This component is a <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> plugin, thus needing it in order to work. You can either download it from <a href="https://jquery.com/download/" target="_blank">here</a> or import it from a CDN.

In the head of your HTML page include it as <b>before</b> this component's <code>.js</code>, as follows: <br />
<code>
&#60;script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;
</code>

### Importing popup-js
You could either clone/download this repository or use the links of the raw files to mimic a CDN in your project. After you imported jQuery, the next thing is to import <code>popup-js.js</code> as follows:<br />
<code>
&#60;script src="popup-js.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;
</code>

You could (and I would recommend) also include the stylesheet of the Popup component, like so: <br />
<code>
&#60;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="popup-js.css" /&#62;
</code>
